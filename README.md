# File Compression

<<<<<<< HEAD
Compress any file format faster with Huffman Encoding. 

## Dependency

This command-line application is written in C/C++ and requires gcc/g++ compiler.

## Installation 

Makefile is provided. $make can be used. Or manually compiler the driver file.

## Algorithm

File is read from command line which allow reading binary format of any files. After reading, all the bits are inserted into Binary Heap which provides bit manipulations and applying huffman encodings.
=======
Command line application written in C++ which compresses files despite the format with [huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) algorithm.

## Installation

Makefile is provided. Simply download the project and run following command inside project repo.
```
$ make
```
